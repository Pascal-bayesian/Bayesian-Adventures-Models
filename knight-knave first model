### Overview
This Netica model represents a classical *Knights and Knaves* puzzle where one character always tells the truth and the other always lies.

### Structure
- **Nodes:** TypeA, TypeB, StatementA, StatementB, Consistency
- **States:** boolean (true/false)
- **Key equation:**  
  `Yes = ((Type == knight) == Q)`  
  (a compact biconditional linking statement truth to type)

### Purpose
To demonstrate how logical biconditionals can be expressed in Bayesian network equations, and how inference reveals which character is the knight or knave.

### Interpretation
Entering evidence about one statement automatically updates belief about the characters’ types.
