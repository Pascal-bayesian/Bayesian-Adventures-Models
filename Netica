## Netica Models

Bayesian networks built using Netica (`.dne` files).

Each subfolder or file includes:
- The `.dne` model file
- A `.png` or `.gif` image showing the network
- A short explanation of the logic and structure

# Bayesian Adventures — Open Model Library

A growing open collection of **Bayesian Network models** for logic, reasoning, and education.

### 🧩 Includes
- **Netica models** (`.dne`)
- **GeNIe models** (`.xdsl`)
- **Agena.AI models** (`.agn`)
- Visuals, PDFs, and notes under `/docs`

### 🎯 Purpose
To make probabilistic reasoning **transparent, reproducible, and interactive**,  
bridging Bayesian networks with logic puzzles, philosophy, and teaching tools.

### 📁 Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `netica/` | Netica-based networks |
| `genie/`  | GeNIe-based networks |
| `agena/`  | Agena.AI-based networks |
| `docs/`   | Supplementary materials |
